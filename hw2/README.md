# Assignment 2: Album Tracker 2.0 by YOURNAME

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own assignment details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
2 days

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The beauty of the gui and the classification of functions

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The code still has a lot of redundancy and can continue to be simplified

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Able to check google by yourself, look through kivy's official documents, and learn to use kivy's interface

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
You can write the logic first, then test each function clearly, and finally connect the gui, because the logic and the gui are separated, and they complement each other and interfere with each other.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
learning resources: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/
Search for keywords or find the corresponding module in the official document, so as to imitate the corresponding gui in the demo he gave

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
I have never written kivy's gui, especially for app.kv. I donâ€™t have a deep understanding of how the components of the gui are distributed and positioned, and it is very slow to write.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Class is the basis for information encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
We can encapsulate similar objects into a class, and then add descriptive attributes to it to achieve the purpose of encapsulation
